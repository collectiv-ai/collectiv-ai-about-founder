## 1. Profile

My name is **David Miecznikowski**, I am 41 years old and I bring **over 20 years of hands-on industrial experience** – from:

- mechanical engineering  
- special-purpose machine building  
- maintenance & repair of complex systems  
- 24/7 on-call duty in production-critical environments  
- up to working as a **Field Service Engineer** in the semiconductor industry

My field assignments and customers included, among others:

- **Krones AG**  
- **Infineon**  
- **Bosch**  

This background shaped the way I work: structured, reliable, calm under pressure and always close to the real system.

Today I am deliberately transitioning into **IT, cybersecurity and AI-driven infrastructure**, building on:

- my industrial field experience  
- a self-built macOS & Linux lab  
- and transparent, documented scripts and setups here on GitHub

I am looking for roles such as:

- **Junior IT System Engineer**  
- **(Junior) Cybersecurity Engineer**  
- **Technical Field Engineer (IT / Infrastructure / Semiconductor)**  

where I can combine **field service + IT & security + lab practice**.

---

## 2. From Industry to IT & Cybersecurity

I combine two worlds:

1. **Industry & Semiconductor Experience**
   - installation, commissioning and maintenance of complex vacuum pump systems  
   - troubleshooting under time pressure in cleanroom & high-availability environments  
   - shift work and 24/7 on-call duty  
   - direct, hands-on work at customer sites (Krones, Infineon, Bosch)

2. **IT, Security & Automation (self-built lab)**
   - **macOS M2 Max** as central workstation  
   - multiple **Linux VMs** (Kali Linux “Large”, Parrot OS, Ubuntu) via **UTM**  
   - WiFi & network lab (e.g. WiFi Pineapple, Alfa adapters, 4G/5G dongles)  
   - Shell scripting (bash/zsh) for system & security checks  
   - first **Python** steps for tools and automation  
   - experiments with **local AI models** (e.g. via Ollama) for system/log analysis

## 3. Lab & Tech Stack

### 3.1 Lab overview

- **macOS M2 Max** as central workstation (CollectivAI base system)
- Multiple **Linux VMs** via **UTM**:
  - Kali Linux “Large”
  - Parrot OS
  - Ubuntu Server (e.g. for nodes / services)
- **Network & WiFi lab**:
  - WiFi Pineapple Tactical (lab only)
  - WiFi adapters
  - 4G/5G dongles
- **Automation & scripting**:
  - Shell (bash/zsh) for system & security checks
  - first Python steps for tooling and automation
- **AI experiments**:
  - local models via Ollama
  - idea: use AI to support system and log analysis

### 3.2 Focus areas

- **IT & Security**
  - Linux administration in lab environments (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu)
  - basic network and WiFi analysis in controlled setups
  - awareness for privacy, compliance and responsible security testing

- **Infrastructure thinking**
  - high availability mindset from semiconductor background
  - “keep the system running” attitude
  - focus on uptime, stability and clear documentation

### 3.3 Key skills (summary)

- Industrial field service (semiconductor, vacuum systems, cleanroom)
- Linux in lab environments (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu)
- macOS M2 Max as main platform
- Shell scripting for checks & automation
- Basic Python for tooling
- Strong hands-on mindset and calm troubleshooting

## 4. Projects on GitHub

This portfolio repository links to projects that are relevant for recruiters, teams and partners.

### 4.1 `security-scripts`

Repository with **clean, well-documented shell scripts** for:

- `macos-system-security-check.sh`  
  → overview of security-relevant settings on macOS (FileVault, firewall, Gatekeeper, etc.)

- `linux-basic-security-check.sh`  
  → basic security check for Linux (OS info, firewall, SSH config, failed logins)

- `network-quickcheck.sh`  
  → safe network quickcheck (interfaces, routes, DNS snippet, ping tests)

All scripts are designed for **my own systems and lab setups only** and show how I structure security and system checks.
