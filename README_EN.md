## 1. Profile

My name is **David Compasso**, I’m 41 years old and bring **20+ years of real industrial experience** from:

- mechanical engineering  
- special-purpose machine building  
- maintenance and repair of complex systems  
- 24/7 on-call duty in production-critical environments  
- working as a **Field Service Engineer** in the semiconductor industry  

Key customers and environments included:

- **Krones AG**  
- **Infineon**  
- **Bosch**  

This background shaped how I work: structured, reliable, calm under pressure – always close to the real system.

Today I am deliberately shifting my focus towards **IT, cybersecurity, AI-driven infrastructure and blockchain ecosystems** – based on a self-built lab and fully documented setups on GitHub under the **CollectiVAI** umbrella.

I’m looking for roles such as:

- **(Junior) IT System Engineer**  
- **(Junior) Cybersecurity Engineer**  
- **Technical Field Engineer (IT / infrastructure / semiconductor)**  
- Roles at the intersection of **AI, nodes, infrastructure & security**

---

## 2. From Industry to IT, Security & AI

I connect two worlds:

1. **Industrial & semiconductor experience**
   - Installation, commissioning and maintenance of complex vacuum and production systems  
   - Troubleshooting under time pressure in cleanroom and high-availability environments  
   - Shift work and 24/7 on-call duty  
   - hands-on work directly on customer sites (Krones, Infineon, Bosch)

2. **IT, security, AI & automation (self-built lab)**
   - **macOS M2 Max** as central workstation and control plane  
   - multiple **Linux VMs** (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu Server) via **UTM**  
   - WiFi & network lab (WiFi Pineapple MK7 Tactical, Alfa adapters, 4G/5G dongles)  
   - shell scripting (zsh/bash) for system, security and node checks  
   - **Python** and Web3 tooling for automation and blockchain interaction  
   - experiments with **local AI models, agents and bots**  
   - strong focus on **privacy, Tor, VPN, DNS-over-Tor** and distributed crypto/AI infrastructure
